# stock-price-prediction
This project aims to predict stock prices of a single company, Uniqlo listed in the Japanese stock market. One of the largest clothing retailers in Japan, Uniqlo has been around for over five decades. The prediction models are built using historical stock market data ranging from 2012 to 2016 and various machine learning techniques.

## Introduction
Stock price prediction plays a crucial role in financial analysis and decision-making. This project focuses specifically on predicting stock prices for Uniqluo in the Japanese market. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, I aim to develop accurate models that can forecast future stock prices.

## Data
The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock market data for Uniqluo listed in the Japanese stock market. It includes attributes such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, trading volume, and other relevant factors. The data is collected from reliable sources and covers from 2012 to 2016. There is also a test data to validate the performance of the model. 

## Models
We employ various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices. Some of the models implemented in this project include:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model that establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

Random Forest: A powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to generate predictions.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture commonly used for sequential data analysis, such as time series data.
